Linus is the hero

He needs to defeat godzilla

Godzilla is causing disrepair in the directory system

What does disrepair look like?
	Buildings/houses get moved to the wrong location, need to fix that by using mv to put them in the right place

Instead of cat, we will have them run scripts
	This will be more interactive than just reading files
	they will use cat for objects they dont need to interact with like houses and bldgs

use ls to scan surroundings
	dont use -a argument, we need to hide things

cd allows you to trvel between areas

the citizens/npcs will be scripts that just echo things
	using scripts to allow dialog, not just monolog, with cases and switches

city is Directoropolis

unzipping as a way of making the rubble better and usable

UNGZ for un godzilla

put a citizen in the zipped rubble, so the player can free them when they ungz

solving some kind of puzzle at the end of the game, instead of a boss battle
	that way they can actually win and not lose

defeating godzilla in a certain number of lines as an additional challenge
	use history to check how many lines theyve typed

teach touch by having people rebuilding the file (its non existent, and they need to build it)

win the game by deleting godzilla 

introduce chmod by saying certain files are guarded or protected, the player needs to give themself perms to enter to bypass protections

grep by having them search (through rubbble, perhaps) for a specific file/npc to talk to

rendering mostly consists of verifying important permissions
	executables need to be able to execute
	not just on our machine

no need to have a reset script, they can just load the file
