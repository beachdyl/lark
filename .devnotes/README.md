DEV LOG: Brett
Currently Working on: @Dan npc script
I made the intro of the game roughly, am working on a directory schema and game progression. The game is meant to start in LARK/Direcoropolis/Linus_house/Bedroom

I made the FIRST_STREET quest and added an NPC with an interesting conversation scheme
	- Moved and made the start file work
	- Removed dirGen because it was not useful or relevant code
	- Working on the rubble mechanic
	- Need to work on minigames/ puzzles
