Everything in directoropolis (diropolis for short)

before game, theyre taught how to run scripts

linusn wakes up in his home
	we need to teach him to ls to see in the environment he is in

use alias to wait for ls and immediately return ls and then prompt
	prompt is that you noitice a sign and they are taught cat to learn how to read the sign

sign instructs them on how to cd

he steps ouside onto 5th ave

on 5th ave we need some other houses
	the houses on the treet have names like bobsHouse

we need to have a missing/problematic house

linus notices a person standing in the street
	we should make the script react appropriately if the user cats the script
	the npc informs linus of godzilla, says he took dan's house and didnt even leave any cookies
	npc directs linus into the city to talk to a stacy

now linus cds into diropolis

now they have a bunch of dirs and bldgs in diropolis bc its a big city
